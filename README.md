# BouncingSquares
This is the first part of my final CSCI 201 skills video. I edited the bouncing balls program to make the balls squares and added a winter break theme.
I made everything red and green for christmas and changed the text box to say have a good break instead of hello world. I also changed all of the balls 
into squares and changed the bounce mechanics so the balls completely change directions no matter which wall they hit.

The website that runs the program is at: https://0987654321poi.github.io/BouncingSquares/
